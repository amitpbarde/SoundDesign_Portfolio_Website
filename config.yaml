    content: |-
      I am a sound designer with experience in linear and interactive media. I have worked on short films, theatre productions, games and interactive installations. I enjoy all aspects of audio, and am always on the lookout for challenging and interesting work. Get in touch to explore how we can collaborate and bring your world - real or virtual - to life with evocative and immersive sounds. 
      
      I am also a researcher with an interest in the use of spatialised audio for information delivery. In addition to this, I am interested in exploring the role of sound in evoking empathy.
